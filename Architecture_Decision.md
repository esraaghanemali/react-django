# Architecture Decision: Separate Repositories vs. Monorepo

## Why Separate Repositories?

1. **Specialized Tooling and Dependencies**
By maintaining separate repositories, each part of your application can manage its dependencies independently. This isolation prevents conflicts between frontend and backend dependencies and simplifies updates and maintenance. For instance, React might require frequent updates to libraries like React itself or vite, which are not needed by Django.
2. **Focused Build Processes**
React's build process, typically managed through tools like vite, can be complex and involves various transformations and optimizations (e.g., minification, bundling). Separating the repositories allows each build process to be optimized for its specific environment. This can speed up build times and make the continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines more efficient.
3. **Improved Scalability**
With separated codebases, it's easier to scale the backend independently of the frontend. It also allows for different scaling strategies, such as using a Content Delivery Network (CDN) for frontend assets while scaling backend services based on API load.
4. **Dedicated Hosting and Deployment**
Different hosting solutions can be optimized for each part of the application. the backend might use cloud services that offer powerful computational resources and database optimizations. Separate repositories make it easier to deploy these components to their ideal environments.
5. **Prevent Single Point of Failure**
Keeping the frontend and backend in separate repositories can help prevent a single point of failure in the system. for that we can take the structure furthur to separate multiple parts of the stack from each other.
